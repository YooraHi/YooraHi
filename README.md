- 👋 Hi, My name is Shophia Jeong.
- I'm interested in Multimodal and Vision with Medical data. 
- I love art and reading books and nature ☘️ 
- Keep learning and keep trying in your life !

I am conducting research on predictive models using NICU data at the AI Center of Samsung Medical Center.

From 2018 to the first quarter of 2022, I served as the Main Product Manager for new original drugs, 
including Anesthetics and Opioid analgesics, at a Pharmaceutical Company. 

During this time, I organized launch symposiums and gained a comprehensive understanding of the pharmaceutical industry’s trends over those four years.
I believe that this experience, despite its challenges, has contributed to who I am today, allowing me to diligently pursue my dreams every day.

For more details about my aspirations, please refer to social accounts.
